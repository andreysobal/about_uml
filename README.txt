This is a website about the UML (Unified modeling language).

All materiales I took from online course "Introduction to the UML" 
by Alexandr Babich (Александр Бабич)(http://www.intuit.ru/studies/courses/1007/229/info). 
It's interesting, understundable and good state lecture. Followin this link you can find 
more about UML and pass some exams for obtain certificate of the online University "Intuit".

I took this material just to try change a form of representation of this material, for 
make it more accessible to preseption, more easy to read.

All rights to the lesson I hade taken belong to Alexandr Babich (Александр Бабич) and 
the online University "Intuit".
